# RFBS
Bayesian phylogenetic model that extends the Dispersal-Extinction-Cladogenesis model to consider how anagenetic and cladogenetic events cause established and enabled biome affinities (or, more generally, other discrete realized versus fundamental niche states) to shift over evolutionary timescale.
